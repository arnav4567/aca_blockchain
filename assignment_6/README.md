This code implements a basic local web server using Express.js.

We send a POST request which contains JSON encoded data in the format - {"data":"some string"}.
Following this, the endpoint calculates the SHA-256 hash of the given string(in hexadecimal) and returns it as JSON encoded data - {"hash":"<the hash value>"}

To send the POST request, we can use -

1. Command prompt, with the command `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8787/hash -d "{\"data\": \"This is a string\"}".`
2. Some tool like 'Postman'. 


On executing the code and sending the post request given below, this output would be shown in the console-

CMD:
`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8787/hash -d "{\"data\": \"hello there\"}"`


CONSOLE : 
```
Server is at localhost:8787

Data is :  {"data":"hello there"}
{"hash":"12998c017066eb0d2a70b94e6ed3192985855ce390f321bbdb832022888bd251"} 
```
