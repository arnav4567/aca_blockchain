# Blocks and Chains - ACA
This project was offered by Association for Computing Activities (ACA), IIT Kanpur. 

### [Assignment 1](./assignment_1)
This assignment was about **finding the nonce** for a given string i.e. it tries to find a positive number x such that when x is appended to the end of the given input, the SHA256 hash is less than the target. 
It contains the following file:
+ [Assg1.js](./Assignment1/Assg1.js): The `crypto-js` module is used in the program.


### [Assignment 2](./assignment_2)
This assignment was about **verifying signatures**.

It contains three files:
+ [assg2_key_pair_gen.js](./assignment_2/assg2_key_pair_gen.js) - To generate a public key-private key pair.
+ [assg2_text_encrypt.js](./assignment_2/assg2_text_encrypt.js) - To sign a message with the private key.
+ [assg2_text_decrypt.js](./assignment_2/assg2_text_decrypt.js) - To check if a given encrypted message decrypted with public key is the same as the message before signing with the private key. 



### [Assignment 3](./assignment_3)
This assignment converts transaction data into a **binary file (.dat)**. It has the following file : 

+ [assg3_data_to_binary.js](./assignment_3/assg3_data_to_binary.js) 

### [Assignment 4](./assignment_4)
This does the opposite of assignment 3. It takes input in binary format and outputs transaction data in readable form. A sample output is also included. It has one file :

+ [assg4_binary_to_data.js](./assignment_4/assg4_binary_to_data.js)


### [Assignment 5](./assignment_5)
Given a transaction block, this assignment deals with finding out the header for that block. A sample `.dat` binary file is included as transaction data. A detailed description is also included in the [assignment_5](./assignment_5) directory.
Some sample outputs are also included. The only `.js` file is : 

+ [assg5_block_header.js](./assignment_5/assg5_block_header.js).

### [Assignment 6](./assignment_6)
This code implements a basic local web server using `Express.js`. We send a POST request which contains JSON encoded data in the format - {"data":"some string"}. The endpoint calculates the SHA-256 hash of the given string(in hexadecimal) and returns it as JSON encoded data.

+ [assg6_web_server.js](./assignment_6/assg6_web_server.js)
